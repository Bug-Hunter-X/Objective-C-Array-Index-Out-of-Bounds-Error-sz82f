This code attempts to access an array element using an index that's out of bounds.  This results in an unexpected behavior or crash. 

```objectivec
NSArray *myArray = @[@1, @2, @3];
NSInteger index = 5; // Index out of bounds
NSInteger value = [myArray objectAtIndex:index]; // Crash or unexpected behavior
NSLog (@"Value at index %ld: %ld", (long)index, (long)value);
```
